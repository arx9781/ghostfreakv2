# What is Lunarvim?

Lunarvim is an IDE layer for Neovim that comes pre-configured with everything you need to get started. While it can serve as a foundation for building your own configuration, it's already feature-rich enough that adding more customizations might unnecessarily complicate things.

I recommend using Lunarvim as an introduction to what a Neovim configuration can become. Once you're comfortable with Lua and ready to truly customize Neovim to your preferences, you can uninstall Lunarvim and configure the init file yourself. **Note: Custom configuration is beyond the scope of this guide.**

While this tutorial focuses on Windows, the process is similar for UNIX-based operating systems like Mac and Linux. If there's enough interest, I'll create a separate Linux tutorial.

## Prerequisites

First, you'll need to install several dependencies. Here's how to get started:

1. Open Terminal with Administrator privileges

2. Install Chocolatey (Windows package manager)
   ```powershell
   # Visit my blog for detailed Chocolatey installation instructions
   # Link: [How to Install Chocolatey]
   ```

3. Install Neovim using Chocolatey:
   ```powershell
   choco install neovim
   ```

4. Configure Neovim:
   - Extract the Neovim zip file
   - Locate the `bin` folder
   - Add the path to your environment variables
   - Verify installation by running:
   ```powershell
   nvim
   ```
   > **Tip**: To exit Neovim, type `:q` and press Enter

5. Install required dependencies:
   ```powershell
   choco install git make node npm pip python cargo ripgrep -y
   ```
   > The `-y` flag automatically answers "yes" to all prompts

6. Verify installations:
   ```powershell
   git --version
   node --version
   npm --version
   python --version
   cargo --version
   rg --version
   ```

## Installing Lunarvim

Now that we have all dependencies installed, let's set up Lunarvim:

```powershell
# Install Lunarvim using the Windows installation script
# Copy the installation command from the Windows tab on Lunarvim's website
```

To test the installation, open a file with Lunarvim:
```powershell
lvim c:/javascript/palindrome.js
```

## Basic Usage

Here are some essential commands to get you started:

```
| Mode     | Command | Description                 |
| -------  | ------  | --------------------------  |
| Normal   | `i`     | Enter insert mode           |
| Insert   | `Esc`   | Return to normal mode       |
| Normal   | `:w`    | Save changes                |
| Normal   | `:q`    | Quit Lunarvim               |
| Normal   | `:wq`   | Save and quit               |
```

Since Lunarvim is a keyboard-driven editor, it's crucial to learn these basic commands. I recommend exploring Neovim tutorials to become more proficient with the editor. Unlike traditional IDEs like VSCode, Lunarvim keeps your hands on the keyboard, potentially improving your typing speed and efficiency.
